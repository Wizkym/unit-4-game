This fun game lets you collect crystals to match a preset number of crystals.
Each time the game loads, a different number is generated which the player tries to match by clicking the crystal images on screen.
Each crystal image holds a different value, so it's up to the player to deduce how many more crystals(clicks) and which crystal to click on.
Exceeding the preset number equals a loss and a new game session is loaded.
